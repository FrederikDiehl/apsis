Beta
==========

A toolkit for hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms. 

Our goal is to provide a flexible, simple and scaleable approach - parallel, on clusters and/or on your own machine.

Note that apsis only supports python 2.

We currently are in a beta version. 
Functionality has been implemented, but has not been used by many people, and there are still advances to tackle.
