Development has ceased
======================
Unfortunately, due to a new job, I have been unable to find the time to continue developing apsis. If you are still interested in bayesian hyperparameter optimization, you can take a look at, for example, [mlrMBO](http://mlr-org.github.io/mlrMBO/).
Should you want to continue this project, feel free to do so, and feel free to contact me for any questions.

apsis
=====

Beta
==========

A toolkit for hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms. 

Our goal is to provide a flexible, simple and scaleable approach - parallel, on clusters and/or on your own machine.

Apsis is open-sourced under the MIT license (see License.txt)

Note that apsis only supports python 2.

State
-----

We currently are in a beta version. 
Functionality has been implemented, but has not been used by many people, and there are still advances to tackle.

Documentation
-------------

Our docs are hosted at [apsis.readthedocs.org](http://apsis.readthedocs.org).

We have a mailing list, at [apsis-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apsis-users).

We also have an IRC channel, at irc.freenode.net #apsis.
