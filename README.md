A toolkit for hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms. 

Our goal is to provide a flexible, simple and scaleable approach - parallel, on clusters and/or on your own machine.

State
------

We currently are in a pre-alpha version. That is, functionality is still highly limited, and documentation very much lacking.
