Welcome to apsis's documentation!
=================================

A toolkit for hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms.

Our goal is to provide a flexible, simple and scaleable approach - parallel, on clusters and/or on your own machine. Check out our usage tutorials to get started or the design pages to understand how apsis works.
